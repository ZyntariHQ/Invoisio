/**
 * Minimal client helper for the Invoisio `invoice-payment` Soroban contract.
 *
 * ## Instantiation
 * Create one instance per process lifetime; the `rpc.Server` and
 * `Keypair` are initialised once in the constructor and reused across calls.
 *
 * ## Complexity
 * | Method           | Time                       | Space |
 * |------------------|----------------------------|-------|
 * | `recordPayment`  | O(k), k ≤ MAX_POLL_ATTEMPTS | O(1) |
 * | `getPayment`     | O(1)                       | O(1) |
 * | `hasPayment`     | O(1)                       | O(1) |
 * | `getPaymentCount`| O(1)                       | O(1) |
 *
 * Read methods use `new Account(pk, '0')` instead of `server.getAccount()`.
 * Simulation does not validate the sequence number, so this saves one
 * full network round-trip per read call.
