# 🧾 Invoisio — Privacy‑Focused AI Invoice Generator on Stellar
https://invoisio-roan.vercel.app/ 

Invoisio is a modern, privacy‑first invoice platform. It combines AI‑assisted invoice creation with fast, low‑cost crypto payments on the **Stellar network**. Payments are sent directly to merchant accounts using Stellar's native **Payment** operation. Optional **memos** (text or hash) carry the invoice identifier for reliable off‑chain matching and reconciliation.

Invoisio is being adapted to run with grant programs on **GrantFox (grantfox.xyz)** so contributors can help fund and use the app in real projects.

## ✨ Highlights

- AI‑assisted invoice creation with clean, responsive UI
- Wallet‑based authentication (Freighter, Lobstr, Albedo, etc.); no passwords
- Ultra‑low‑cost payments on Stellar: XLM and USDC
- Real‑time backend reconciliation via Horizon (listen for payments + memo)
- Privacy‑first mindset; collect only what’s necessary

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm or npm
- A Stellar wallet (Freighter, Lobstr, Albedo, or StellarX)
- Testnet XLM from Friendbot faucet: `https://friendbot.stellar.org/?addr=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY`

Replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` with your Stellar testnet address (starts with `G`).

### 1) Configure Backend (Horizon & Merchant Account)

Create `backend/.env` and set:

```env
# Stellar network
HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org
STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
# For mainnet later: https://horizon.stellar.org + "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015"

# Merchant receiving account (your app's merchant public key)
MERCHANT_PUBLIC_KEY=GBXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Optional USDC issuer & asset (Circle USDC on Stellar)
USDC_ISSUER=GA5ZSEJYB37JRC5AVCIA5MOP4RHTM335X2KGX3IHOJAPP5RE34K4KZVN
USDC_ASSET_CODE=USDC

# For memo matching (your app logic decides format)
MEMO_PREFIX=invoisio-

# Database, auth, etc.
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
JWT_SECRET=...
```

Then:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run start:dev
```

The backend will be responsible for:
- Creating and storing invoices and their identifiers
- Watching Horizon for incoming payments to `MERCHANT_PUBLIC_KEY`
- Matching payments by memo (e.g., `invoisio-<invoiceId>`)

### 2) Run the Frontend (Next.js)

```bash
cd webapp
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

The frontend handles:
- AI‑assisted invoice creation
- Displaying payment details for Stellar (destination, asset, amount, memo)
- Connecting a Stellar wallet (e.g., Freighter) to sign Payment operations

## 🔐 Authentication

- Wallet signature flow; no passwords
- Users own their identity via their Stellar wallet
- Minimal data collection to preserve privacy

## 🔧 Soroban (Stellar smart contracts)

The `smart-contracts/` workspace contains Rust-based Soroban contracts built with the official `stellar contract init` template.

### `invoice-payment` contract (live in `smart-contracts/contracts/invoice-payment/`)

Tracks invoice payments on-chain so the backend can reconcile Soroban events with native Horizon payment streams.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `initialize(admin)` | One-time setup; sets the backend service account as admin. |
| `record_payment(invoice_id, payer, asset_code, asset_issuer, amount)` | Persist record + emit `("payment","recorded")` event. |
| `get_payment(invoice_id)` | Return stored `PaymentRecord`. |
| `has_payment(invoice_id)` | Non-panicking existence check. |

Every `record_payment` emits a Soroban event carrying the full `PaymentRecord`, enabling any indexer to subscribe via `stellar events` CLI or the Soroban RPC `getEvents` endpoint.

- Native Stellar payments:
  - Destination: `MERCHANT_PUBLIC_KEY`
  - Asset: XLM or USDC on Stellar
  - Memo: `MEMO_PREFIX + <invoiceId>` for off‑chain matching
- Soroban (`smart-contracts/`):
  - `invoice-payment` contract records and indexes payment state
  - Events consumers can stream: topics `("payment", "recorded")`
  - Future room for programmable discounts, escrow, or milestone payments

See [`smart-contracts/README.md`](smart-contracts/README.md) for full build, deploy, and invocation instructions.

## 📚 Development Scripts

  - `npm run start` — run built app
- Backend:
  - `npm run start:dev` — run NestJS in watch mode
  - `npm run test` / `npm run test:e2e` — tests
- Soroban contracts (`smart-contracts/`):
  - `stellar contract build` — compile to WASM
  - `cargo test` — run all unit tests (no network needed)
  - `make deploy` — deploy to Stellar testnet (from `contracts/invoice-payment/`)
  - `make invoke-record-payment CONTRACT_ID=<id> ...` — call contract on testnet
  - See [`smart-contracts/README.md`](smart-contracts/README.md) for full details
- Legacy contracts/Hardhat (EVM prototype, optional):
  - `npx hardhat compile` — compile contracts
  - `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network baseSepolia` — deploy router
  - `npx hardhat run scripts/tx-demo.js --network baseSepolia` — send demo payment

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (neumorphic styling)
- Radix UI + shadcn/ui components
- NestJS + Prisma (PostgreSQL)
- Stellar network (Horizon testnet/mainnet)

## 🧭 GrantFox & Contributors
